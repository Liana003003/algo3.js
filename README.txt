I did algo.js entirely on GitHub, algo3.js will be done with Git
I realised I did the exercise wrong. I kinda skipped over the part that said we had to use Git so we could practice with it. I didn't want to accidentally delete the codes I had already written so I decided to make a second repository to practice with. Better safe than sorry :)
